Criteria
- Containing machine learning and ai stuff
- Contain considerable data analysis
- Be physics relavant, particularly aerospace, energy
- Ideally some area where you're not repeating past stuff but is a new thing (in fact, ideally related to future research or even PhD)
- Achievable given time span of 24hr + 12hr (outside class); data generation 
- Include visualisation but not too much (though some could be possibly made to game like)

Potential choices
- Plasma dynamics (ideally try to play around with magnetic confinement, cost interest in fusion): can learn stuff, but hard, good thing is its in line with my technical aspects
	- Or perhaps at least just simple particle simulation in stuff for magnetic confinement
	- Tokamak confinement; tokamak scattering; tokamak drift
	- Gravitational drift
	- ExB drift
	- Gradient drift
- Brachistochrone: DO THIS FOR MORE SO SIMPLE STUFF
	- Computationally confirming that that shape is the precise solution
	- Alterning starting position and checking that time remains unchanged
	- Branchistochrone with friction
	- Analyse different variables and their effects on descent time, relate to acceleration curves and profiles and so on and consider energy treatments
- Simple rocket simulation, rocket equation: DO THIS IF WANNA CHECK IF LIKE AEROSPACE
	- Ideal speeds given atmospheric resistsnce (might become too complicated)
	- Optimal staging
	- Ideal fuel use vs time
	- Going to alpha centauri


Less likely stuff cos too technical for my level, though i'd say look into fusion
- Orbital reconstruction based on obersvational data on earth (i.e. regressing stuff like distances (for now i guess just the solar system is nice) focus on past data and stuff) seems intriguing
	- Use known data to train (perhaps do AI as well; or maybe numeric solution solving; the idea is if Galileo could do it I'm sure we could)
	- Use known data to validify
	- Use new more recent data and so on to predcit (and see if conforms with predictions of the academics) on properties of the bodies (I guess mainly focuso n position as opposed to other harder stuff (though if turns out easy the mass calculation is possible as well but that requires far more effort i think))
- n-body problem in 3D # seems likely: easy but extensible; issue, don't get to learn much physics though i guess possible as well we'll see
	- Chaos (more indepth look into chaos theory)
	- Orbital manoeuvre
	- Space trajectory rocket launching 
	- Ideal path planning from Earth to say Mars: i.e. predict best time to launch and so on, gravitational slingshot
- Hydroelectricity simulation
- Tidal energy simulation
- Fusion: one of Too much theory for realistic carry out
	- Plasma confinement
	- Fusion in sun
	- Tokamak
- Ion engine
- Information and energy
- Aerofoil lift
- Modelling space elevator (2D should be viable)
	- Stress in material
	- Payload
	- Counter weight
	- Orbit design
- Traffic modelling (urban road design or the simplified thing)
- Energy use modelling and predictions; both in energy units and cost units (so along that energy economic idea) (i mean epidemiology is suggested, so energy sue?)
	- Come up with some model for say energy use and demand and so on; use past data to train parameters; use a validation data set to validify, use other data to predict and test
	- Energy demand
	- Energy cost
	- Long time trends
	- The main issue is do this or plasma; cos i kinda don't wanna do economics stuff, more so interested in the physics
